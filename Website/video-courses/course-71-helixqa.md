## Module 1: QA Orchestrator Setup (30 min)

### Video 1.1: HelixQA Architecture (15 min)

**Topics:**
- HelixQA composes: detector + validator + reporter + testbank + evidence + ticket
- The `SessionCoordinator` manages full lifecycle of autonomous QA sessions
- Dependencies: `digital.vasic.challenges`, `digital.vasic.containers`, DocProcessor, LLMOrchestrator, VisionEngine
- Configuration: platforms, speed mode, device, output directory, report format

**Key Types:**
```go
type SessionCoordinator struct {
    config       *SessionConfig
    orchestrator agent.AgentPool
    visionEngine analyzer.Analyzer
    featureMap   *feature.FeatureMap
    workers      map[string]*PlatformWorker
    phaseManager *PhaseManager
    session      *session.SessionRecorder
    coverage     coverage.CoverageTracker
}
```

### Video 1.2: SessionConfig and Defaults (15 min)

**Topics:**
- `SessionID`, `OutputDir`, `Platforms`, `Timeout`, `CoverageTarget`
- Curiosity-driven exploration: `CuriosityEnabled` and `CuriosityTimeout`
- Default: 2-hour timeout, 90% coverage target, all platforms, curiosity on
- Speed modes: slow (debugging), normal (default), fast (CI pipelines)
- Connecting the AgentPool and VisionEngine as injected dependencies

**Default Config:**
```go
func DefaultSessionConfig() *SessionConfig {
    return &SessionConfig{
        Platforms:        []string{"android", "desktop", "web"},
        Timeout:          2 * time.Hour,
        CoverageTarget:   0.90,
        CuriosityEnabled: true,
        CuriosityTimeout: 30 * time.Minute,
    }
}
```

## Module 2: Test Bank YAML Format (30 min)

### Video 2.1: Test Bank Structure (15 min)

**Topics:**
- YAML-based test bank files with platform and priority filtering
- Test case fields: name, description, steps, expected, platform, priority
- The `testbank` package: loading, filtering by platform, sorting by priority
- Reusing `digital.vasic.challenges` bank loading infrastructure

**Example Test Bank:**
```yaml
test_cases:
  - name: login_valid_credentials
    description: Verify login with valid email and password
    platform: all
    priority: critical
    steps:
      - action: tap_element
        target: email_field
        value: "user@example.com"
      - action: tap_element
        target: password_field
        value: "secure123"
      - action: tap_element
        target: login_button
    expected: "Dashboard screen is displayed"
```

### Video 2.2: Filtering and Prioritization (15 min)

**Topics:**
- Platform filtering: `android`, `web`, `desktop`, `all`
- Priority levels: critical, high, medium, low
- Running critical tests first for fast feedback
- Combining test banks from multiple YAML files

---

## Module 3: Crash and ANR Detection (30 min)

### Video 3.1: Detector Architecture (15 min)

**Topics:**
- The `detector` package: real-time crash and ANR detection across platforms
- `CommandRunner` interface: abstraction for command execution (testable with mocks)
- Android: ADB logcat monitoring for crash traces and ANR dialogs
- Web: browser console error monitoring via Playwright/CDP
- Desktop: JVM exception and process exit monitoring

### Video 3.2: Configuring Detection (15 min)

**Topics:**
- Step-by-step validation: `ValidateSteps` mode checks after each action
- Crash signature parsing: extracting stack traces and error messages
- ANR detection: timeout thresholds and unresponsive process signals
- Integration with the validator for immediate evidence capture on detection

**Detector Usage:**
```go
detector := detector.NewCrashDetector(
    detector.WithCommandRunner(runner),
    detector.WithPlatform(config.PlatformAndroid),
    detector.WithDevice("emulator-5554"),
    detector.WithPackage("dev.helix.agent"),
)
issues, err := detector.Check(ctx)
```

## Module 4: Evidence Collection Pipeline (25 min)

### Video 4.1: Evidence Types and Collection (10 min)

**Topics:**
- Evidence artifacts: screenshots, video recordings, device logs, stack traces
- The `evidence` package: centralized collection and storage
- Timestamped evidence linked to specific test steps
- Output directory structure: `qa-results/sessions/<session-id>/`

### Video 4.2: Building the Pipeline (15 min)

**Topics:**
- Automatic screenshot capture on test step failure
- Video recording start/stop around test execution
- Log collection from ADB, browser console, and JVM stderr
- Compressing and archiving evidence for CI artifact storage
- Linking evidence to the CoverageTracker from DocProcessor

---

## Module 5: Ticket Generation (20 min)

### Video 5.1: Structured Issue Tickets (10 min)

**Topics:**
- The `ticket` package generates Markdown tickets for detected issues
- Ticket fields: title, description, reproduction steps, evidence links, severity
- Designed for AI fix pipelines: structured format for LLM consumption
- Automatic severity classification based on crash type and frequency

### Video 5.2: Ticket Templates and Integration (10 min)

**Topics:**
- Customizing ticket templates for different issue trackers
- Linking tickets to test bank entries and feature IDs
- Batch ticket generation after a full QA session
- Routing tickets to appropriate teams based on platform and category

**Generated Ticket Example:**
```markdown
## Bug: Login Crash on Invalid Input
**Severity:** Critical | **Platform:** Android | **Session:** helix-1711234567

### Reproduction Steps
1. Open the application
2. Enter invalid email format in login field
3. Tap Login button
4. Application crashes with NullPointerException

### Evidence

- Stack trace: evidence/stacktrace-001.txt
```

## Module 6: Session Management (25 min)

### Video 6.1: Session Lifecycle and Phases (15 min)

**Topics:**
- `PhaseManager` controls session progression: setup, execute, curiosity, report
- `SessionRecorder` logs events, timings, and coverage milestones
- Coverage-driven termination: session ends when target is reached
- Timeout handling: graceful stop with evidence collection on timeout

### Video 6.2: Hands-On Lab (10 min)

**Objective:** Run a complete autonomous QA session against a sample application.

**Steps:**
1. Write a YAML test bank with 5 test cases across 2 platforms
2. Configure a `SessionConfig` with 80% coverage target
3. Launch the session coordinator with mock agent pool and vision engine
4. Monitor phase transitions and coverage progress
5. Inspect the generated QA report and issue tickets
6. Verify evidence artifacts in the output directory

## Assessment

### Quiz (10 questions)

1. What are the core dependencies of HelixQA?

5. What is the `CommandRunner` interface and why is it important for testing?
6. What evidence types are collected by the evidence pipeline?
7. How are issue tickets structured for AI fix pipelines?
8. What triggers the curiosity-driven exploration phase?

10. How does HelixQA integrate with DocProcessor's CoverageTracker?

### Practical Assessment

Build a complete HelixQA session:
1. Write a YAML test bank with 10 test cases (3 critical, 4 high, 3 medium)
2. Configure a SessionConfig targeting Android and Web with 85% coverage
3. Implement a mock CommandRunner that simulates 2 crashes
4. Run the session and verify crash detection triggers evidence collection
5. Inspect the generated tickets and QA report

Deliverables:
1. YAML test bank file
2. SessionConfig and launch code
3. Generated QA report and tickets
4. Evidence directory with captured artifacts
