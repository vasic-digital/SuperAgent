# HelixAgent Constitution

**Version:** 1.2.0
**Created:** 2026-02-10
**Updated:** 2026-03-16

Constitution with 28 rules (28 mandatory) across categories: Quality: 2, Safety: 1, Security: 1, Performance: 2, Containerization: 4, Configuration: 2, Testing: 4, Documentation: 2, Principles: 2, Stability: 1, Observability: 1, GitOps: 2, CI/CD: 1, Architecture: 1, Networking: 1, Resource Management: 1

## Architecture

### Comprehensive Decoupling **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-001

Identify all parts and functionalities that can be extracted as separate modules (libraries) and reused in various projects. Perform additional work to make each module fully decoupled and independent. Each module must be a separate project with its own CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README.md, docs/, tests, and challenges.

## Testing

### 100% Test Coverage **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-002

Every component MUST have 100% test coverage across ALL test types: unit, integration, E2E, security, stress, chaos, automation, and benchmark tests. No false positives. Use real data and live services (mocks only in unit tests).

### Comprehensive Challenges **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-003

Every component MUST have Challenge scripts validating real-life use cases. No false success - validate actual behavior, not return codes.

### Stress and Integration Tests **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 2)

**ID:** CONST-014

Introduce comprehensive stress and integration tests validating that the system is responsive and not possible to overload or break.

### Infrastructure Before Tests **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-022

ALL infrastructure containers (PostgreSQL, Redis, Mock LLM) MUST be running before executing tests or challenges. Use `make test-infra-start` or `make test-infra-direct-start` (Podman fallback with `--userns=host`). Tests and challenges that require infrastructure WILL FAIL without running containers.

## Documentation

### Complete Documentation **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-004

Every module and feature MUST have complete documentation: README.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, user guides, step-by-step manuals, video courses, diagrams, SQL definitions, and website content. No component can remain undocumented.

### Documentation Synchronization **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-020

Anything added to Constitution MUST be present in AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md, and vice versa. Keep all three synchronized.

## Quality

### No Broken Components **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-005

No module, application, library, or test can remain broken, disabled, or incomplete. Everything must be fully functional and operational.

### No Dead Code **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-006

Identify and remove all 'dead code' - features or functionalities left unconnected with the system. Perform comprehensive research and cleanup.

## Safety

### Memory Safety **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-007

Perform comprehensive research for memory leaks, deadlocks, and race conditions. Apply safety fixes and improvements to prevent these issues.

## Security

### Security Scanning **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-008

Execute Snyk and SonarQube scanning. Analyze findings in depth and resolve everything. Ensure scanning infrastructure is accessible via containerization (Docker/Podman).

## Performance

### Monitoring and Metrics **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 2)

**ID:** CONST-009

Create tests that run and perform monitoring and metrics collection. Use collected data for proper optimizations.

### Lazy Loading and Non-Blocking **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 2)

**ID:** CONST-010

Implement lazy loading and lazy initialization wherever possible. Introduce semaphore mechanisms and non-blocking mechanisms to ensure flawless responsiveness.

## Principles

### Software Principles **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 2)

**ID:** CONST-011

Apply all software principles: KISS, DRY, SOLID, YAGNI, etc. Ensure code is clean, maintainable, and follows best practices.

### Design Patterns **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 2)

**ID:** CONST-012

Use appropriate design patterns: Proxy, Facade, Factory, Abstract Factory, Observer, Mediator, Strategy, etc. Apply patterns where they add value.

## Stability

### Rock-Solid Changes **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-013

All changes must be safe, non-error-prone, and MUST NOT BREAK any existing working functionality. Ensure backward compatibility unless explicitly breaking.

## Containerization

### Full Containerization **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 2)

**ID:** CONST-015

All services MUST run in containers (Docker/Podman/K8s). Support local default execution AND remote configuration. Services must auto-boot before HelixAgent is ready.

### Mandatory Container Orchestration Flow **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-015a

The ONLY acceptable container orchestration flow: (1) HelixAgent boots and initializes Containers module adapter, (2) Adapter reads Containers/.env file (NOT project root .env), (3) Based on CONTAINERS_REMOTE_ENABLED: true=ALL containers to remote hosts via CONTAINERS_REMOTE_HOST_* vars, false/missing=ALL containers locally, (4) Health checks against configured endpoints, (5) Required services failing health check cause boot failure. Rules: NO manual container starts, NO mixed mode, tests use tests/precondition/containers_boot_test.go, challenges verify container placement. Key files: Containers/.env, internal/config/config.go:isContainersRemoteEnabled(), internal/services/boot_manager.go, tests/precondition/containers_boot_test.go.

### Container-Based Builds **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-021

ALL release builds MUST be performed inside Docker/Podman containers for reproducibility. Use `make release` / `make release-all`. Version info injected via `-ldflags -X`. No release binaries should be built directly on the host unless container build is unavailable.

### Mandatory Container Rebuild **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-015b

All running containers on local host or remote distributed machines MUST be rebuilt and redeployed if code was changed affecting any of them. After code changes to services, handlers, MCPs, formatters, or any containerized component: rebuild affected images, restart containers, re-run distribution if using remote hosts.

## Configuration

### Unified Configuration **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-016

**CLI agent configs MUST ONLY be generated using the HelixAgent binary** (`./bin/helixagent --generate-agent-config=<agent>` or `go run ./cmd/helixagent --generate-agent-config=<agent>`). **NEVER create, write, or modify CLI agent config files manually or via scripts.** The HelixAgent binary is the sole authority for config generation. Config generation uses LLMsVerifier's unified generator (`pkg/cliagents/`). No third-party scripts or manual edits. This ensures schema compliance, API key injection, MCP endpoint consistency, and validation for all 48 supported CLI agents.

### Non-Interactive Execution **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-016a

ALL commands MUST be fully non-interactive and automatable via command pipelines. NEVER prompt for passwords, passphrases, or any user input interactively. SSH connections MUST use key-based authentication. All secrets MUST be provided via environment variables or .env files, never via interactive prompts.

## Observability

### Health and Monitoring **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 2)

**ID:** CONST-017

Every service MUST expose health endpoints. Circuit breakers for all external dependencies. Prometheus/OpenTelemetry integration.

## GitOps

### GitSpec Compliance **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 2)

**ID:** CONST-018

Follow GitSpec constitution and all constraints from AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md.

### SSH Only for Git Operations **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-018a

MANDATORY: NEVER use HTTPS for any Git service operations. All cloning, fetching, pushing, and submodule operations MUST use SSH URLs (git@github.com:org/repo.git). HTTPS is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN even for public repositories. SSH keys are already configured on all Git services (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

## CI/CD

### Manual CI/CD Only **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-019

**NO GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or any automated pipeline** may exist in this repository! **NO Git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push, post-commit, etc.)** may be installed or configured. All builds, tests, and quality checks must be executed manually only via Makefile targets. This rule is permanent and non-negotiable.

## Networking

### HTTP/3 (QUIC) with Brotli Compression **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-023

ALL HTTP communication MUST use HTTP/3 (QUIC) as primary transport with Brotli compression. HTTP/2 only as fallback when HTTP/3 is unavailable. Compression priority: Brotli (primary) then gzip (fallback). All HTTP clients and servers MUST prefer HTTP/3. Use `quic-go/quic-go` for transport and `andybalholm/brotli` for compression.

## Resource Management

### Test and Challenge Resource Limits **[MANDATORY]** (Priority: 1)

**ID:** CONST-024

ALL test and challenge execution MUST be strictly limited to 30-40% of host system resources. Use GOMAXPROCS=2, nice -n 19, ionice -c 3, and -p 1 for go test. Container limits required. Host machine runs mission-critical processes; exceeding limits has caused system crashes and forced resets.
