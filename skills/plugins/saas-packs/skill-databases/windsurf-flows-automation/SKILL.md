# Windsurf Flows Automation

## Overview

This skill enables creation and management of Windsurf Flows - automated workflows that handle repetitive development tasks. Flows can scaffold components, generate boilerplate, run test sequences, and execute multi-step operations with a single command. They combine Cascade AI intelligence with deterministic automation for reliable, repeatable results.

## Prerequisites

- Windsurf IDE with Cascade enabled
- Understanding of repetitive tasks to automate
- Project templates and patterns documented
- Test scenarios for flow validation
- Team agreement on automation standards

## Instructions

1. **Identify Repetitive Tasks**
2. **Design Flow Structure**
3. **Create Flow Definitions**
4. **Test and Validate**
5. **Deploy and Monitor**


See `{baseDir}/references/implementation.md` for detailed implementation guide.

## Output

- Flow definition files
- Reusable template library
- Execution logs for audit
- Rollback capabilities

## Error Handling

See `{baseDir}/references/errors.md` for comprehensive error handling.

## Examples

See `{baseDir}/references/examples.md` for detailed examples.
