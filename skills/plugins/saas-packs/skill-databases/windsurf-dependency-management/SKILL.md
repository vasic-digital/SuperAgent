# Windsurf Dependency Management

## Overview

This skill enables comprehensive dependency management within Windsurf projects. Cascade analyzes your dependency tree, identifies security vulnerabilities, suggests safe updates, and helps plan migration paths for major version upgrades. It integrates with npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, and other package managers to provide actionable security insights and update recommendations.

## Prerequisites

- Windsurf IDE with Cascade enabled
- Package manager installed (npm, yarn, pnpm, pip)
- Project with package.json, requirements.txt, or equivalent
- Understanding of semantic versioning
- CI/CD pipeline for testing updates (recommended)

## Instructions

1. **Run Initial Audit**
2. **Analyze Update Paths**
3. **Plan Updates**
4. **Apply and Verify**
5. **Establish Monitoring**


See `{baseDir}/references/implementation.md` for detailed implementation guide.

## Output

- Security audit report with findings
- Update plan with prioritized changes
- Compatibility matrix for version combinations
- Migration guides for breaking changes

## Error Handling

See `{baseDir}/references/errors.md` for comprehensive error handling.

## Examples

See `{baseDir}/references/examples.md` for detailed examples.
