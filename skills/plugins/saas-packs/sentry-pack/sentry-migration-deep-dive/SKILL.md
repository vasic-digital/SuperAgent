# Sentry Migration Deep Dive

## Prerequisites

2. Set up Sentry projects matching existing structure
3. Install Sentry SDK alongside existing tool for parallel running
4. Map feature equivalents between old tool and Sentry APIs
5. Run both tools in parallel for 2-4 weeks
6. Compare error capture rates and verify parity
7. Recreate alert rules in Sentry matching old tool
8. Export historical data from old tool API if needed
9. Remove old SDK dependencies and configuration
10. Train team on Sentry dashboard and cancel old subscription

## Output
- SDK migration complete
