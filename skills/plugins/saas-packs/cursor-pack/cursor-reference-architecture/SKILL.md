# Cursor Reference Architecture

## Overview

This skill provides reference architecture patterns for Cursor IDE projects. It covers project structure conventions, configuration file architecture, team workflows, monorepo patterns, and security considerations for enterprise-ready setups.

## Prerequisites

- Project with defined architecture patterns
- Understanding of project structure conventions
- Team alignment on coding standards
- Cursor IDE configured for team use

## Instructions

1. Choose project structure (feature-based or layer-based)
2. Create comprehensive .cursorrules file
3. Configure .cursorignore for indexing
4. Set up workspace settings for team
5. Document architecture decisions
6. Create onboarding documentation

## Output

- Well-organized project structure
- Comprehensive .cursorrules configuration
- Team-aligned configuration files
- Documented architecture patterns
- AI-friendly codebase

## Error Handling

See `{baseDir}/references/errors.md` for comprehensive error handling.
