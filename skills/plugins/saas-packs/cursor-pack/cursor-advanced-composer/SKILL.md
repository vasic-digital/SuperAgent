# Cursor Advanced Composer

## Overview

This skill covers advanced Cursor Composer techniques for complex multi-file edits. It provides patterns for coordinated file creation, architecture migrations, pattern replication, and quality control workflows for large-scale code generation.

## Prerequisites

- Cursor IDE with Composer feature access
- Understanding of project structure and patterns
- Well-configured .cursorrules file
- Indexed codebase for @-mention references

## Instructions

1. Open Composer with Cmd+I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows)
2. Describe the feature or changes needed
3. Reference existing patterns with @-mentions
4. Specify file structure and naming conventions
5. Review each proposed change before applying
6. Apply changes incrementally, testing between phases

## Output

- Multiple coordinated file changes
- Generated feature modules with consistent patterns
- Refactored codebase following specified patterns
- Complete test coverage for generated code
