## Error Handling
| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| No Audio Captured | Wrong audio source | Check system audio settings |
| Meeting Not Detected | Calendar event missing | Manually start recording |
| Processing Failed | Audio quality issues | Ensure stable internet during meeting |
| Notes Empty | Meeting too short | Minimum ~2 minutes required |

## Tips for Better Notes
1. **Speak clearly** - AI transcription improves with clear audio
2. **Use participant names** - Helps with speaker identification
3. **State action items explicitly** - "Action item: Sarah will..."
4. **Summarize at end** - Recap key decisions verbally
