## Overview

## Prerequisites
- Completed meeting with Granola capture
- Notes generated (typically 1-2 minutes after meeting)

2. Find meeting in recent list
3. Review generated content:
   - Summary accuracy

- [ ] Tag relevant team members
- [ ] Mark confidential sections
```

### Step 3: Extract and Assign Action Items
Process action items for tracking:

```markdown

```

### Step 4: Share with Stakeholders

#### Share via Granola

```

### Step 5: Archive and Categorize

    /q1
      /project-alpha
        2025-01-06-sprint-planning.md
        2025-01-08-client-sync.md
      /team-1-1s
        2025-01-06-sarah-1-1.md
