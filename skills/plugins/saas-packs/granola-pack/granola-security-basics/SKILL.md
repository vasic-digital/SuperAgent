## Access Control Best Practices

### Personal Account Security
```markdown
## Checklist
- [ ] Use strong unique password
- [ ] Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication)
- [ ] Review connected apps regularly
- [ ] Log out from shared devices
- [ ] Use SSO if available (Business/Enterprise)
```

### Sharing Permissions
| Share Level | Access | Use Case |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Private | Owner only | Sensitive meetings |
| Team | Workspace members | Internal meetings |
| Link (View) | Anyone with link | Read-only sharing |
| Link (Edit) | Anyone with link | Collaborative notes |

### Configure Sharing Defaults
```
Settings > Privacy > Default Sharing
- New meetings: Private (recommended)
- Auto-share with attendees: Off (for sensitive meetings)
- External sharing: Disabled (for compliance)
```

## Sensitive Meeting Handling

### Pre-Meeting
```markdown
## Sensitive Meeting Checklist
- [ ] Disable auto-recording
- [ ] Confirm attendee list
- [ ] Review sharing settings
- [ ] Check for screen share visibility
- [ ] Consider using "Off the Record" mode
```

### During Meeting
- Announce recording to all participants
- Pause recording for sensitive discussions
- Avoid displaying sensitive documents on screen

### Post-Meeting
- Review notes before sharing
- Redact sensitive information
- Use private sharing link
- Set expiration on shared links

## Data Retention & Deletion

### Retention Settings
```
Settings > Privacy > Data Retention

Options:
- Keep forever (default)
- Delete audio after 30 days
- Delete audio after 7 days
- Delete audio immediately after processing

Recommendation: Delete audio after processing
(Notes are retained, raw audio is deleted)
```

### Manual Deletion

2. Click ... menu > Delete
3. Confirm deletion
4. Note: Deletion is permanent

## Bulk Deletion
