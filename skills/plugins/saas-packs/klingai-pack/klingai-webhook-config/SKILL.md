This skill shows how to configure webhook endpoints to receive real-time notifications when video generation jobs complete, fail, or change status in Kling AI.

## Prerequisites

- Kling AI API key configured
- Public HTTPS endpoint for webhook receiver

## Instructions

Follow these steps to configure webhooks:

1. **Create Endpoint**: Set up a webhook receiver endpoint
2. **Register Webhook**: Configure webhook URL with Kling AI
3. **Verify Signatures**: Validate webhook authenticity
4. **Handle Events**: Process different event types
5. **Implement Retries**: Handle delivery failures

## Webhook Event Types
