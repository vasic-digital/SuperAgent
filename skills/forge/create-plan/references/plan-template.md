# [Task Name]

## Objective

[Provide a clear, concise statement of what this plan aims to achieve. Include expected outcomes and success indicators. Be specific about the end goal.]

## Implementation Plan

**All tasks must use checkbox format for tracking:**

- [ ] 1. [First major task]
  - Detailed description of what needs to be done
  - Rationale: Why this task is necessary
  - Dependencies: What must be completed before this
  - Key considerations: Important factors to keep in mind

- [ ] 2. [Second major task]
  - Detailed description of what needs to be done
  - Rationale: Why this task is necessary
  - Dependencies: What must be completed before this
  - Key considerations: Important factors to keep in mind

- [ ] 3. [Third major task]
  - Detailed description of what needs to be done
  - Rationale: Why this task is necessary
  - Dependencies: What must be completed before this
  - Key considerations: Important factors to keep in mind

[Continue with additional tasks as needed]

## Verification Criteria

Define specific, measurable criteria to verify successful completion:

- [Criterion 1]: Specific test or check that confirms this aspect works
- [Criterion 2]: Measurable outcome that indicates success
- [Criterion 3]: Observable behavior that validates the implementation
- [Criterion 4]: Performance or quality metric that must be met

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

Identify risks and provide concrete mitigation strategies:

1. **[Risk Name/Description]**
   - Impact: [Describe the potential impact if this risk occurs]
   - Likelihood: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Mitigation: [Specific strategy to prevent or minimize this risk]
   - Contingency: [Backup plan if mitigation fails]

2. **[Risk Name/Description]**
   - Impact: [Describe the potential impact if this risk occurs]
   - Likelihood: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Mitigation: [Specific strategy to prevent or minimize this risk]
   - Contingency: [Backup plan if mitigation fails]

[Continue with additional risks as needed]

## Alternative Approaches

Document alternative solutions considered and their trade-offs:

1. **[Alternative Approach 1]**
   - Description: [How this approach would work]
   - Pros: [Advantages of this approach]
   - Cons: [Disadvantages or limitations]
   - Recommendation: [Why chosen or not chosen]

2. **[Alternative Approach 2]**
   - Description: [How this approach would work]
   - Pros: [Advantages of this approach]
   - Cons: [Disadvantages or limitations]
   - Recommendation: [Why chosen or not chosen]

[Continue with additional alternatives as needed]

## Assumptions

Document any assumptions made during planning:

- [Assumption 1]: [Why this assumption was made]
- [Assumption 2]: [Why this assumption was made]
- [Assumption 3]: [Why this assumption was made]

## Dependencies

List external dependencies or prerequisites:

- [Dependency 1]: [What is needed and why]
- [Dependency 2]: [What is needed and why]
- [Dependency 3]: [What is needed and why]
