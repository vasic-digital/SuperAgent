The Main HelixAgent Challenge has been executed successfully using **REAL API verification**.
No sample or hardcoded data was used. All models were verified through actual API calls.

This challenge:

1. Verified all configured LLM providers using real API keys
2. Benchmarked and scored available LLMs with real API calls
3. Formed an AI Debate Group with 5 primary members and fallbacks
4. Verified the complete system as a single OpenAI-compatible endpoint
5. Generated OpenCode configuration with all features
