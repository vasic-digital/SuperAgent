## Technical Debt Analysis

### Build System Issues
```
ERROR: undefined: grpc.ServerStreamingClient
ERROR: cannot use nil as models.ModelParameters value
ERROR: function main is undeclared in the main package
```
**Root Cause**: Outdated gRPC library versions and incomplete protocol buffer generation

### Architecture Gaps
1. **No HTTP3/Quic Implementation** - Required by specification
2. **Missing Cognee Integration** - Memory enhancement system not implemented
3. **No Plugin Hot-Reload** - Dynamic plugin loading not functional
4. **Missing Database Layer** - PostgreSQL integration incomplete

### Security Vulnerabilities
- No authentication implementation
- Missing input validation
- No encryption for sensitive data
- Absence of security scanning integration
