## Slide 9: Core Components

**Internal Package Structure:**

- `internal/llm/` - LLM provider abstractions
- `internal/services/` - Business logic
- `internal/handlers/` - HTTP handlers
- `internal/middleware/` - Auth, rate limiting
- `internal/cache/` - Redis, in-memory caching
- `internal/plugins/` - Plugin system
- `internal/optimization/` - Performance tools

---

## Slide 10: Provider Abstraction Layer

**LLMProvider Interface:**

```go
type LLMProvider interface {
    Complete(ctx, request) (*Response, error)
    CompleteStream(ctx, request) (chan StreamChunk, error)
    HealthCheck(ctx) error
    GetCapabilities() *Capabilities
    ValidateConfig() error
}
```

*All providers implement this common interface*

---

## Slide 11: Ensemble Orchestration

**How Ensemble Works:**

1. Request received via API
2. Request routed to multiple providers (parallel)
3. Responses collected and evaluated
4. Voting strategy applied
5. Best response selected and returned

*Visual: Flow diagram showing parallel processing*

---

## Speaker Notes

### Slide 3 Notes
Emphasize real-world pain points organizations experience with single-provider dependencies. Mention outages, pricing changes, and capability limitations as concrete examples.

### Slide 8 Notes
Walk through the architecture slowly, explaining how requests flow from the API Gateway through the Ensemble Engine or Debate Service, down to the Provider Registry and individual providers.

### Slide 11 Notes
Demonstrate with a simple example: "If we ask Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek the same question, we get three different perspectives. The ensemble engine evaluates these and selects or combines the best response."

### Slide 12 Notes
The AI Debate System is a unique differentiator. Explain how multiple AI agents with different "personalities" can debate a topic to reach a more nuanced conclusion.
