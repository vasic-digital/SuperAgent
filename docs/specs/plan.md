# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Research phase completed - all NEEDS CLARIFICATION have been RESOLVED
  The Technical Context section now contains comprehensive technical specifications
  based on constitutional requirements and research findings.
-->

**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+ (MANDATORY)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Gin Gonic framework (MANDATORY), SQLCipher, HTTP3/Quic libraries  
**Storage**: Postgres (production) or SQLite with SQLCipher (development)  
**Testing**: Go testing package + comprehensive test suite (Unit, Integration, E2E, Stress, Security, Challenges)  
**Target Platform**: Linux server with Docker containerization  
**Project Type**: Single Go service with plugin architecture  
**Performance Goals**: High concurrency LLM request handling, sub-100ms response times for cached responses  
**Constraints**: HTTP3/Toon default with HTTP2/JSON fallback, 100% test coverage, zero security vulnerabilities  
**Scale/Scope**: Support multiple concurrent LLM providers, extensible plugin system for new models

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **GATE PASSED** - All constitutional requirements have been addressed with detailed technical specifications.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
