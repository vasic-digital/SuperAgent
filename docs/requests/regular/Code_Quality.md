Perform comprehensive research for memory leaks, dead locks, race conditions and apply safety fixes and improvements so this does not happen ever! Execute Snyk and SonarQube scanning with mechanisms we have supported and after in depth scanning analyze findings and resolve everything! Create tests which will run and perform monitoring and metrics collecting based on which proper optimizations will be done! make sure we do implement as much as possible lazy loading and lazy initialization, introduction of semaphore mechanisms and non-blocking mechanisms so responsiveness of every single part of the project is flawless! changes we apply must be rock-solid, safe, non-error-prone and they MUST NOT BREAK any existing working functionality! Increase coverage with the tests to theoretical maximum! Introduce comprehensive stress and integration tests which will validate that system is responsive like the flash and not possible to overload or break! Document all work up to nano details! Extend all existing documentation, user-guides, manual, video courses, website, diagrams, SQL definitions and other existing materials!
