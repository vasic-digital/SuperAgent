Create me now a full report of unfinished stuff and the detailed step by step plan in phases on how to implement everything, cover it with all supported test types (ALL types we support and our tests bank framework) and variety of Challenges, having complete project documentation, full step by step user manuals, extended and update video courses, extended and updated video courses and finally completely updated content of the Website. No module, application, library, test can stay broken or disabled or with no 100% tests coverage and full documentation! Make sure that you do not start any interactive process during your work which may for example request root or sudo password. We cannot have anything unfinished, uncompleted, undocumented, broke or disabled! Look for any 'dead code' which represents the whole features or functionalities left unconnected with the system / application(s). Perform comprehensive research for memory leaks, dead locks, race conditions and apply safety fixes and improvements so this does not happen ever! Execute Snyk and SonarQube scanning with mechanisms we have supported (if we do not make sure we have them accessible via Compose technology and containers running in Docker or Podman) and after in depth scanning analyze findings and resolve everything! Create tests which will run and perform monitoring and metrics collecting based on which proper optimizations will be done! make sure we do implement as much as possible lazy loading and lazy initialization, introduction of semaphore mechanisms and non-blocking mechanisms so responsiveness of every single part of the project is flawless! changes we apply must be rock-solid, safe, non-error-prone and they MUST NOT BREAK any existing working functionality! Increase coverage with the tests to theoretical maximum! Introduce comprehensive stress and integration tests which will validate that system is responsive like the flash and not possible to overload or break! Document all work up to nano details! Extend all existing documentation, user-guides, manual, video courses, website, diagrams, SQL definitions and other existing materials! Make sure you respect GitSpec constitution and all constratints from Agents.md and Claude.md markdown files!
