We have to extent our intent mechanism of the HelixAgent so it determines if request received is creation of something small, something big, whole functionality, debugging, fixing, working on the improvements or just single action which has to be executed. If the Intent is building bigger part of the application or changing it GitHub SpecKit is going to be used by the AI debate team and whole SpecKit flow performed. AI debate team will based on the current knowledge of the project and inputs create comprehensive Constitution and execute the Constitution part of the flow if there is none. If needed existing Constitution will be updated and extended. AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md markdown documentation and all existing technical documentation and AI Requests documents will be used for this purpose as well. After Constitution is completed, the rest of SpecKit driven development phases will be executed one by one by our AI debate team: Constitution -> Specify -> Clarify -> Plan -> Tasks -> Analyze -> Implement. SpecKit will perform all implementation using our AI debate team! Some mandatory points will be added into the Constitution ALWAYS, obtain from this specification: "It has to be respected a comprehensive decoupling. Goal is to identify all parts and functionalities of the system which can be extracted as separate module (library) and reused in various other projects. Any additional work to make each decoupled module fully decoupled and independent we should do. Additional tests and Challenges MUST BE added per module! Each module MUST become separate individual project with its own CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md documentation files. Each must have its own main REDME.md landing page with docs directory containing all relevant documentation for the module (sub-project). We must create for each module comprehensive documentation, user guides and manuals, video courses, diagrams, SQL definitions and website. Perform in depth analysis and planning and divide whole work effort into the phases with tasks. Make sure we are tracking the progress so we can any time stop with the work and continue whenever we like! We must use all 10 (or so) software principles: kiss, dry, and others ... We should use powerful design patterns like proxy, facade, factory, abstract factory, observer, mediator, and others ..." and "over it with all supported test types (ALL types we support and our tests bank framework) and variety of Challenges, having complete project documentation, full step by step user manuals, extended and update video courses, extended and updated video courses and finally completely updated content of the Website. No module, application, library, test can stay broken or disabled or with no 100% tests coverage and full documentation! Make sure that you do not start any interactive process during your work which may for example request root or sudo password. We cannot have anything unfinished, uncompleted, undocumented, broke or disabled! Look for any 'dead code' which represents the whole features or functionalities left unconnected with the system / application(s). Perform comprehensive research for memory leaks, dead locks, race conditions and apply safety fixes and improvements so this does not happen ever! Execute Snyk and SonarQube scanning with mechanisms we have supported (if we do not make sure we have them accessible via Compose technology and containers running in Docker or Podman) and after in depth scanning analyze findings and resolve everything! Create tests which will run and perform monitoring and metrics collecting based on which proper optimizations will be done! make sure we do implement as much as possible lazy loading and lazy initialization, introduction of semaphore mechanisms and non-blocking mechanisms so responsiveness of every single part of the project is flawless! changes we apply must be rock-solid, safe, non-error-prone and they MUST NOT BREAK any existing working functionality! Increase coverage with the tests to theoretical maximum! Introduce comprehensive stress and integration tests which will validate that system is responsive like the flash and not possible to overload or break! Document all work up to nano details! Extend all existing documentation, user-guides, manual, video courses, website, diagrams, SQL definitions and other existing materials! Make sure you respect GitSpec constitution and all constratints from Agents.md and Claude.md markdown files!".
