Integrate ACP ("Agent Communication Protocol") into LLMsVerifier and HelixAgent. We MUST have full and comprehensive implementation of this protocol for further integration with complex systems and workflows! Create unit and integration tests which will cover 100% of new codebase and all use cases! Create Challenges which will confirm that everything is working flawlessly in all use case scenarios with no false positives (false success). Each Challenge success must be validated and verified! Write proper documentation, user guides, manuals, new video courses for new features and extend the website! Pay attention to all existing diagrams, SQL definitions and other materials which MUST BE up to date with current system codebase!
