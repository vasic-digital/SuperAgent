3. **Testing + AI Debate**: `DebateLLMEvaluator` for test evaluation
4. **Memory + RAG**: Entity extraction feeds knowledge graph
5. **Workflow + Providers**: Node handlers use provider registry
6. **Semantic Router + Providers**: Route to appropriate model tier
7. **RLAIF + AI Debate**: `AIRewardModel` uses debate for scoring
8. **LLMOps + AI Debate**: `DebateLLMEvaluator` for A/B test evaluation
9. **Benchmarks + AI Debate**: `DebateAdapterForBenchmark` for benchmark evaluation
10. **Benchmarks + LLMsVerifier**: `VerifierAdapterForBenchmark` for provider selection

## Notes & Blockers
- Existing Qdrant client is comprehensive (771 lines)
- OpenTelemetry already in go.mod (v1.38.0)
- Several "bugs" in original research were already fixed
- All packages designed for co-existence with existing systems
- All new packages include integration adapters for AI Debate system
- All new packages include integration adapters for LLMsVerifier
